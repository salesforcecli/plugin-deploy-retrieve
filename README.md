### CLA

External contributors will be required to sign a Contributor's License
Agreement. You can do so by going to https://cla.salesforce.com/sign-cla.

### Build

To build the plugin locally, make sure to have yarn installed and run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:salesforcecli/plugin-project

# Install the dependencies and compile
yarn install
yarn build
```

To use your plugin, run using the local `./bin/run` or `./bin/run.cmd` file.

```bash
# Run using local run file.
./bin/run project
```

There should be no differences when running via the Salesforce CLI or using the local run file. However, it can be useful to link the plugin to do some additional testing or run your commands from anywhere on your machine.

```bash
# Link your plugin to the sf cli
sf plugins:link .
# To verify
sf plugins
```

## Commands

<!-- commands -->
* [`sf project:deploy`](#sf-projectdeploy)

## `sf project:deploy`

deploy a Salesforce project

```
USAGE
  $ sf project:deploy

OPTIONS
  --directory=directory    directory to deploy
  --interactive            TBD
  --target-env=target-env  TBD

DESCRIPTION
  Deploy a project, including org metadata and functions. Be default, the deploy analyze your project and assume
  sensible defaults when possible, otherwise it will prompt. To always prompt and not assume defaults, use
  "--interctive".
  To run specialized deploys, especially when interactivity isn't an option like continuous deployment, used the scoped
  deploy commands like "sf project deploy org" or "sf project deploy functions"

EXAMPLES
  sf project:deploy
  sf project:deploy --remote
```
