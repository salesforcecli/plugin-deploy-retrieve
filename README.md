## `sf deploy`

Deploy a project interactively to any Salesforce environment.

```
USAGE
  $ sf deploy [--interactive]

FLAGS
  --interactive  Force the CLI to prompt for all deployment inputs.

DESCRIPTION
  Deploy a project interactively to any Salesforce environment.

  This command must be run from within a project.

  The command first analyzes your project, your active or logged-into environments, and local defaults to determine what
  to deploy and where to deploy it. The command then prompts you for information about this particular deployment and
  provides intelligent choices based on its analysis.

  For example, if your local project contains a source directory with metadata files in source format, the command asks
  if you want to deploy that Salesforce app to an org. The command lists your connected orgs and asks which one you want
  to deploy to. The list of orgs starts with scratch orgs, ordered by expiration date with the most recently created one
  first, and then Dev Hub and production orgs ordered by name. If the command finds Apex tests, it asks if you want to
  run them and at which level.

  The command stores your responses in the "deploy-options.json" file in your local project directory and uses them as
  defaults when you rerun the command. Specify --interactive to force the command to reprompt.

  Use this command for quick and simple deploys. For more complicated deployments, use the environment-specific
  commands, such as "sf deploy metadata", that provide additional flags.

EXAMPLES
  Deploy a project and use stored values from a previous command run:

    $ sf deploy

  Reprompt for all deployment inputs:

    $ sf deploy --interactive
```

DESCRIPTION
  Deploy metadata to an org from your local project.

  You must run this command from within a project.

  Metadata components are deployed in source format by default. Deploy them in metadata format by specifying the
  --metadata-dir flag, which specifies the root directory or ZIP file that contains the metadata formatted files you
  want to deploy.

  If your org allows source tracking, then this command tracks the changes in your source. Some orgs, such as production
  org, never allow source tracking. You can also use the "--no-track-source" flag when you create a scratch or sandbox
  org to disable source tracking.

  To deploy multiple metadata components, either set multiple --metadata <name> flags or a single --metadata flag with
  multiple names separated by spaces. Enclose names that contain spaces in one set of double quotes. The same syntax
  applies to --manifest and --source-dir.

EXAMPLES
  Deploy local changes not in the org:

    $ sf deploy metadata

  Deploy the source files in a directory:

    $ sf deploy metadata  --source-dir path/to/source

  Deploy a specific Apex class and the objects whose source is in a directory (both examples are equivalent):

    $ sf deploy metadata --source-dir path/to/apex/classes/MyClass.cls path/to/source/objects
    $ sf deploy metadata --source-dir path/to/apex/classes/MyClass.cls --source-dir path/to/source/objects

  Deploy all Apex classes:

    $ sf deploy metadata --metadata ApexClass

  Deploy a specific Apex class:

    $ sf deploy metadata --metadata ApexClass:MyApexClass

  Deploy all custom objects and Apex classes (both examples are equivalent):

    $ sf deploy metadata --metadata CustomObject ApexClass
    $ sf deploy metadata --metadata CustomObject --metadata ApexClass

  Deploy all Apex classes and a profile that has a space in its name:

    $ sf deploy metadata --metadata ApexClass --metadata "Profile:My Profile"

  Deploy all components listed in a manifest:

    $ sf deploy metadata --manifest path/to/package.xml

  Run the tests that aren’t in any managed packages as part of a deployment:

    $ sf deploy metadata --metadata ApexClass --test-level RunLocalTests

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -a, --api-version=<value>  Target API version for the deploy.

    Use this flag to override the default API version with the API version of your package.xml file. The default API
    version is the latest version supported by the CLI.

  -c, --ignore-conflicts  Ignore conflicts and deploy local files, even if they overwrite changes in the org.

    This flag applies only to orgs that allow source tracking. It has no effect on orgs that don't allow it, such as
    production orgs.

  -d, --source-dir=<value>...  Path to the local source files to deploy.

    The supplied path can be to a single file (in which case the operation is applied to only one file) or to a folder
    (in which case the operation is applied to all metadata types in the directory and its subdirectories).

    If you specify this flag, don’t specify --metadata or --manifest.

  -g, --ignore-warnings  Ignore warnings and allow a deployment to complete successfully.

    If a warning occurs and this flag is set to true, the success status of the deployment is set to true. When this
    flag is set to false, success is set to false, and the warning is treated like an error.

  -l, --test-level=NoTestRun|RunSpecifiedTests|RunLocalTests|RunAllTestsInOrg  Deployment Apex testing level.

    Valid values are:

    - NoTestRun — No tests are run. This test level applies only to deployments to development environments, such as
    sandbox, Developer Edition, or trial orgs. This test level is the default for development environments.

    - RunSpecifiedTests — Runs only the tests that you specify with the --run-tests flag. Code coverage requirements
    differ from the default coverage requirements when using this test level. Executed tests must comprise a minimum of
    75% code coverage for each class and trigger in the deployment package. This coverage is computed for each class and
    trigger individually and is different than the overall coverage percentage.

    - RunLocalTests — All tests in your org are run, except the ones that originate from installed managed and unlocked
    packages. This test level is the default for production deployments that include Apex classes or triggers.

    - RunAllTestsInOrg — All tests in your org are run, including tests of managed packages.

    If you don’t specify a test level, the default behavior depends on the contents of your deployment package. For more
    information, see [Running Tests in a
    Deployment](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_deploy_running_tests.htm)
    in the "Metadata API Developer Guide".

  -o, --target-org=<value>  Login username or alias for the target org.

    Overrides your default org.

  -r, --ignore-errors  Ignore any errors and don’t roll back deployment.

    When deploying to a production org, keep this flag set to false (default value). When set to true, components
    without errors are deployed and components with errors are skipped, and could result in an inconsistent production
    org.

  -t, --tests=<value>...  Apex tests to run when --test-level is RunSpecifiedTests.

    Separate multiple test names with commas, and enclose the entire flag value in double quotes if a test contains a
    space.

  -w, --wait=<minutes>  Number of minutes to wait for command to complete and display results.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns control of the terminal window to you and
    returns the job ID. To resume the deployment, run "sf deploy metadata resume". To check the status of the
    deployment, run "sf deploy metadata report".

  -x, --manifest=<value>  Full file path for manifest (package.xml) of components to deploy.

    All child components are included. If you specify this flag, don’t specify --metadata or --source-dir.

  --async  Run the command asynchronously.

    The command immediately returns the job ID and control of the terminal to you. This way, you can continue to use the
    CLI. To resume the deployment, run "sf deploy metadata resume". To check the status of the deployment, run "sf
    deploy metadata report".
```

## `sf deploy metadata cancel`

Cancel a deploy operation.

```
USAGE
  $ sf deploy metadata cancel [--json] [--async | -w <value>] [-i <value>] [-r]

FLAGS
  -i, --job-id=<value>   Job ID of the deploy operation you want to cancel.
  -r, --use-most-recent  Use the job ID of the most recent deploy operation.
  -w, --wait=<minutes>   Number of minutes to wait for the command to complete and display results.
  --async                Run the command asynchronously.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Cancel a deploy operation.

  Use this command to cancel a deploy operation that hasn't yet completed in the org. Deploy operations include standard
  deploys, quick deploys, deploy validations, and deploy cancellations.

  Run this command by either passing it a job ID or specifying the --use-most-recent flag to use the job ID of the most
  recent deploy operation.

EXAMPLES
  Cancel a deploy operation using a job ID:

    $ sf deploy metadata cancel --job-id 0Af0x000017yLUFCA2

  Cancel the most recent deploy operation:

    $ sf deploy metadata cancel --use-most-recent

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -i, --job-id=<value>  Job ID of the deploy operation you want to cancel.

    These commands return a job ID if they time out or you specified the --async flag:

    - sf deploy metadata
    - sf deploy metadata validate
    - sf deploy metadata quick
    - sf deploy metadata cancel

    The job ID is valid for 10 days from when you started the deploy operation.

  -r, --use-most-recent  Use the job ID of the most recent deploy operation.

    For performance reasons, this flag uses job IDs for deploy operations that started only in the past 3 days or less.
    If your most recent deploy operations was more than 3 days ago, this flag won't find a job ID.

  -w, --wait=<minutes>  Number of minutes to wait for the command to complete and display results.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns control of the terminal window to you. To
    resume watching the cancellation, run "sf deploy metadata resume". To check the status of the cancellation, run "sf
    deploy metadata report".

  --async  Run the command asynchronously.

    The command immediately returns the control of the terminal to you. This way, you can continue to use the CLI. To
    resume watching the cancellation, run "sf deploy metadata resume". To check the status of the cancellation, run "sf
    deploy metadata report".
```

## `sf deploy metadata preview`

Preview a deployment to see what will deploy to the org, the potential conflicts, and the ignored files.

```
USAGE
  $ sf deploy metadata preview [--json] [-c] [-x <value> | -d <value> | -m <value>] [-o <value>]

FLAGS
  -c, --ignore-conflicts       Ignore conflicts and deploy local files, even if they overwrite changes in the org.
  -d, --source-dir=<value>...  Path to the local source files to preview.
  -m, --metadata=<value>...    Metadata component names to preview.
  -o, --target-org=<value>     Login username or alias for the target org.
  -x, --manifest=<value>       Full file path for manifest (package.xml) of components to preview.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Preview a deployment to see what will deploy to the org, the potential conflicts, and the ignored files.

  You must run this command from within a project.

  The command outputs a table that describes what will happen if you run the "sf deploy metadata" command. The table
  lists the metadata components that will be deployed and deleted. The table also lists the current conflicts between
  files in your local project and components in the org. Finally, the table lists the files that won't be deployed
  because they're included in your .forceignore file.

  If your org allows source tracking, then this command considers conflicts between the org and local. Some orgs, such
  as production orgs, never allow source tracking. Use the "--no-track-source" flag when you create a scratch or sandbox
  org to disable source tracking.

  To preview the deployment of multiple metadata components, either set multiple --metadata <name> flags or a single
  --metadata flag with multiple names separated by spaces. Enclose names that contain spaces in one set of double
  quotes. The same syntax applies to --manifest and --source-dir.

EXAMPLES
  NOTE: The commands to preview a deployment and actually deploy it use similar flags. We provide a few preview examples here, but see the help for "sf deploy metadata" for more examples that you can adapt for previewing.

  Preview the deployment of source files in a directory, such as force-app:

    $ sf deploy metadata preview  --source-dir force-app

  Preview the deployment of all Apex classes:

    $ sf deploy metadata preview --metadata ApexClass

  Preview deployment of a specific Apex class:

    $ sf deploy metadata preview --metadata ApexClass:MyApexClass

  Preview deployment of all components listed in a manifest:

    $ sf deploy metadata preview --manifest path/to/package.xml

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -c, --ignore-conflicts  Ignore conflicts and deploy local files, even if they overwrite changes in the org.

    This flag applies only to orgs that allow source tracking. It has no effect on orgs that don't allow it, such as
    production orgs.

  -d, --source-dir=<value>...  Path to the local source files to preview.

    The supplied path can be to a single file (in which case the operation is applied to only one file) or to a folder
    (in which case the operation is applied to all metadata types in the directory and its subdirectories).

    If you specify this flag, don’t specify --metadata or --manifest.

  -o, --target-org=<value>  Login username or alias for the target org.

    Overrides your default org.

  -x, --manifest=<value>  Full file path for manifest (package.xml) of components to preview.

    All child components are included. If you specify this flag, don’t specify --metadata or --source-dir.
```

## `sf deploy metadata quick`

Quickly deploy a validated deployment to an org.

```
USAGE
  $ sf deploy metadata quick [--json] [--async | -w <value>] [--concise | --verbose] [-i <value>] [-o <value>] [-r]

FLAGS
  -i, --job-id=<value>      Job ID of the deployment you want to quick deploy.
  -o, --target-org=<value>  Login username or alias for the target org.
  -r, --use-most-recent     Use the job ID of the most recently validated deployment.
  -w, --wait=<minutes>      Number of minutes to wait for the command to complete and display results.
  --async                   Run the command asynchronously.
  --concise                 Show concise output of the deploy result.
  --verbose                 Show verbose output of the deploy result.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Quickly deploy a validated deployment to an org.

  Before you run this command, first create a validated deployment with the "sf deploy metadata validate" command, which
  returns a job ID. Validated deployments haven't been deployed to the org yet; you deploy them with this command.
  Either pass the job ID to this command or use the --use-most-recent flag to use the job ID of the most recently
  validated deployment. For the quick deploy to succeed, the associated validated deployment must also have succeeded.

  Executing this quick deploy command takes less time than a standard deploy because it skips running Apex tests. These
  tests were previously run as part of the validation. Validating first and then running a quick deploy is useful if the
  deployment to your production org take several hours and you don’t want to risk a failed deploy.

  This command doesn't support source-tracking. The source you deploy overwrites the corresponding metadata in your org.
  This command doesn’t attempt to merge your source with the versions in your org.

EXAMPLES
  Run a quick deploy to your default org using a job ID:

    $ sf deploy metadata quick --job-id 0Af0x000017yLUFCA2

  Asynchronously run a quick deploy of the most recently validated deployment to an org with alias "my-prod-org":

    $ sf deploy metadata quick --async --use-most-recent --target-org my-prod-org

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -i, --job-id=<value>  Job ID of the deployment you want to quick deploy.

    The job ID is valid for 10 days from when you started the validation.

  -o, --target-org=<value>  Login username or alias for the target org.

    Overrides your default org.

  -r, --use-most-recent  Use the job ID of the most recently validated deployment.

    For performance reasons, this flag uses only job IDs that were validated in the past 3 days or less. If your most
    recent deployment validation was more than 3 days ago, this flag won't find a job ID.

  -w, --wait=<minutes>  Number of minutes to wait for the command to complete and display results.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns control of the terminal window to you. To
    resume watching the deploy, run "sf deploy metadata resume". To check the status of the deploy, run "sf deploy
    metadata report".

  --async  Run the command asynchronously.

    The command immediately returns the control of the terminal to you. This way, you can continue to use the CLI. To
    resume watching the deploy, run "sf deploy metadata resume". To check the status of the deploy, run "sf deploy
    metadata report".
```

## `sf deploy metadata report`

Check the status of a deploy operation.

```
USAGE
  $ sf deploy metadata report [--json] [-i <value>] [-r]

FLAGS
  -i, --job-id=<value>   Job ID of the deploy operation you want to check the status of.
  -r, --use-most-recent  Use the job ID of the most recent deploy operation.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Check the status of a deploy operation.

  Deploy operations include standard deploys, quick deploys, deploy validations, and deploy cancellations.

  Run this command by either passing it a job ID or specifying the --use-most-recent flag to use the job ID of the most
  recent deploy operation.

EXAMPLES
  Check the status using a job ID:

    $ sf deploy metadata report --job-id 0Af0x000017yLUFCA2

  Check the status of the most recent deploy operation:

    $ sf deploy metadata report --use-most-recent

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -i, --job-id=<value>  Job ID of the deploy operation you want to check the status of.

    These commands return a job ID if they time out or you specified the --async flag:

    - sf deploy metadata
    - sf deploy metadata validate
    - sf deploy metadata quick
    - sf deploy metadata cancel

    The job ID is valid for 10 days from when you started the deploy operation.

  -r, --use-most-recent  Use the job ID of the most recent deploy operation.

    For performance reasons, this flag uses job IDs for deploy operations that started only in the past 3 days or less.
    If your most recent operation was more than 3 days ago, this flag won't find a job ID.
```

## `sf deploy metadata resume`

Resume watching a deploy operation.

```
USAGE
  $ sf deploy metadata resume [--json] [--concise | --verbose] [-i <value>] [-r] [-w <value>]

FLAGS
  -i, --job-id=<value>   Job ID of the deploy operation you want to resume.
  -r, --use-most-recent  Use the job ID of the most recent deploy operation.
  -w, --wait=<minutes>   Number of minutes to wait for the command to complete and display results.
  --concise              Show concise output of the deploy operation result.
  --verbose              Show verbose output of the deploy operation result.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Resume watching a deploy operation.

  Use this command to resume watching a deploy operation if the original command times out or you specified the --async
  flag. Deploy operations include standard deploys, quick deploys, deploy validations, and deploy cancellations. This
  command doesn't resume the original operation itself, because the operation always continues after you've started it,
  regardless of whether you're watching it or not.

  Run this command by either passing it a job ID or specifying the --use-most-recent flag to use the job ID of the most
  recent deploy operation.

EXAMPLES
  Resume watching a deploy operation using a job ID:

    $ sf deploy metadata resume --job-id 0Af0x000017yLUFCA2

  Resume watching the most recent deploy operation:

    $ sf deploy metadata resume --use-most-recent

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -i, --job-id=<value>  Job ID of the deploy operation you want to resume.

    These commands return a job ID if they time out or you specified the --async flag:

    - sf deploy metadata
    - sf deploy metadata validate
    - sf deploy metadata quick
    - sf deploy metadata cancel

    The job ID is valid for 10 days from when you started the deploy operation.

  -r, --use-most-recent  Use the job ID of the most recent deploy operation.

    For performance reasons, this flag uses job IDs for deploy operations that started only in the past 3 days or less.
    If your most recent operation was more than 3 days ago, this flag won't find a job ID.

  -w, --wait=<minutes>  Number of minutes to wait for the command to complete and display results.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns control of the terminal window to you. To
    resume watching the deploy operation, run this command again. To check the status of the deploy operation, run "sf
    deploy metadata report".
```

                               package.
  --verbose                    Show verbose output of the validation result.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Validate a metadata deployment without actually executing it.

  Use this command to verify whether a deployment will succeed without actually deploying the metadata to your org. This
  command is similar to "sf deploy metadata", except you're required to run Apex tests, and the command returns a job ID
  rather than executing the deployment. If the validation succeeds, then you pass this job ID to the "sf deploy metadata
  quick" command to actually deploy the metadata. This quick deploy takes less time because it skips running Apex tests.
  The job ID is valid for 10 days from when you started the validation. Validating first is useful if the deployment to
  your production org take several hours and you don’t want to risk a failed deploy.

  You must run this command from within a project.

  This command doesn't support source-tracking. When you quick deploy with the resulting job ID, the source you deploy
  overwrites the corresponding metadata in your org.

  To validate the deployment of multiple metadata components, either set multiple --metadata <name> flags or a single
  --metadata flag with multiple names separated by spaces. Enclose names that contain spaces in one set of double
  quotes. The same syntax applies to --manifest and --source-dir.

EXAMPLES
  NOTE: These examples focus on validating large deployments. See the help for "sf deploy metadata" for examples of deploying smaller sets of metadata which you can also use to validate.

  Validate the deployment of all source files in a directory to the default org:

    $ sf deploy metadata validate --source-dir path/to/source

  Asynchronously validate the deployment and run all tests in the org with alias "my-prod-org"; command immediately
  returns the job ID:

    $ sf deploy metadata validate --source-dir path/to/source --async --test-level RunAllTestsInOrg --target-org \
      my-prod-org

  Validate the deployment of all components listed in a manifest:

    $ sf deploy metadata validate --manifest path/to/package.xml

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -a, --api-version=<value>  Target API version for the validation.

    Use this flag to override the default API version with the API version of your package.xml file. The default API
    version is the latest version supported by the CLI.

  -d, --source-dir=<value>...  Path to the local source files to validate for deployment.

    The supplied path can be to a single file (in which case the operation is applied to only one file) or to a folder
    (in which case the operation is applied to all metadata types in the directory and its subdirectories).

    If you specify this flag, don’t specify --metadata or --manifest.

  -l, --test-level=RunAllTestsInOrg|RunLocalTests|RunSpecifiedTests  Deployment Apex testing level.

    Valid values are:

    - RunSpecifiedTests — Runs only the tests that you specify with the --run-tests flag. Code coverage requirements
    differ from the default coverage requirements when using this test level. Executed tests must comprise a minimum of
    75% code coverage for each class and trigger in the deployment package. This coverage is computed for each class and
    trigger individually and is different than the overall coverage percentage.

    - RunLocalTests — All tests in your org are run, except the ones that originate from installed managed and unlocked
    packages. This test level is the default for production deployments that include Apex classes or triggers.

    - RunAllTestsInOrg — All tests in your org are run, including tests of managed packages.

    If you don’t specify a test level, the default behavior depends on the contents of your deployment package. For more
    information, see [Running Tests in a
    Deployment](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_deploy_running_tests.htm)
    in the "Metadata API Developer Guide".

  -o, --target-org=<value>  Login username or alias for the target org.

    Overrides your default org.

  -w, --wait=<minutes>  Number of minutes to wait for the command to complete and display results.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns control of the terminal window to you and
    returns the job ID. To resume watching the validation, run "sf deploy metadata resume". To check the status of the
    validation, run "sf deploy metadata report".

  -x, --manifest=<value>  Full file path for manifest (package.xml) of components to validate for deployment.

    All child components are included. If you specify this flag, don’t specify --metadata or --source-dir.

  --async  Run the command asynchronously.

    The command immediately returns the job ID and control of the terminal to you. This way, you can continue to use the
    CLI. To resume watching the validation, run "sf deploy metadata resume". To check the status of the validation, run
    "sf deploy metadata report".

DESCRIPTION
  Retrieve metadata from an org to your local project.

  You must run this command from within a project.

  Metadata components are retrieved in source format by default. Retrieve them in metadata format by specifying the
  --target-metadata-dir flag, which retrieves the components into a ZIP file in the specified directory.

  If your org allows source tracking, then this command tracks the changes in your source. Some orgs, such as production
  org, never allow source tracking. You can also use the "--no-track-source" flag when you create a scratch or sandbox
  org to disable source tracking.

  To retrieve multiple metadata components, either use multiple --metadata <name> flags or use a single --metadata flag
  with multiple names separated by spaces. Enclose names that contain spaces in one set of double quotes. The same
  syntax applies to --manifest and --source-dir.

EXAMPLES
  Retrieve remote changes:

    $ sf retrieve metadata

  Retrieve the source files in a directory:

    $ sf retrieve metadata --source-dir path/to/source

  Retrieve a specific Apex class and the objects whose source is in a directory (both examples are equivalent):

    $ sf retrieve metadata --source-dir path/to/apex/classes/MyClass.cls path/to/source/objects
    $ sf retrieve metadata --source-dir path/to/apex/classes/MyClass.cls --source-dir path/to/source/objects

  Retrieve all Apex classes:

    $ sf retrieve metadata --metadata ApexClass

  Retrieve a specific Apex class:

    $ sf retrieve metadata --metadata ApexClass:MyApexClass

  Retrieve all custom objects and Apex classes (both examples are equivalent):

    $ sf retrieve metadata --metadata CustomObject ApexClass
    $ sf retrieve metadata --metadata CustomObject --metadata ApexClass

  Retrieve all metadata components listed in a manifest:

    $ sf retrieve metadata --manifest path/to/package.xml

  Retrieve metadata from a package:

    $ sf retrieve metadata --package-name MyPackageName

  Retrieve metadata from multiple packages, one of which has a space in its name (both examples are equivalent):

    $ sf retrieve metadata --package-name Package1 "PackageName With Spaces" Package3
    $ sf retrieve metadata --package-name Package1 --package-name "PackageName With Spaces" --package-name Package3

  Retrieve the metadata components listed in the force-app directory, but retrieve them in metadata format into a ZIP
  file in the "output" directory:

    $ sf retrieve metadata --source-dir force-app --target-metadata-dir output

  Retrieve in metadata format and automatically extract the contents into the "output" directory:

    $ sf retrieve metadata --source-dir force-app --target-metadata-dir output --unzip

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -a, --api-version=<value>  Target API version for the retrieve.

    Use this flag to override the default API version, which is the latest version supported the CLI, with the API
    version in your package.xml file.

  -c, --ignore-conflicts

    Ignore conflicts and retrieve and save files to your local filesystem, even if they overwrite your local changes.

    This flag applies only to orgs that allow source tracking. It has no effect on orgs that don't allow it, such as
    production orgs.

  -d, --source-dir=<value>...  File paths for source to retrieve from the org.

    The supplied paths can be to a single file (in which case the operation is applied to only one file) or to a folder
    (in which case the operation is applied to all source files in the directory and its subdirectories).

  -o, --target-org=<value>  Login username or alias for the target org.

    Overrides your default org.

  -w, --wait=<value>  Number of minutes to wait for the command to complete and display results to the terminal window.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns control of the terminal window to you.

  -x, --manifest=<value>  File path for the manifest (package.xml) that specifies the components to retrieve.

    If you specify this parameter, don’t specify --metadata or --source-dir.
```

## `sf retrieve metadata preview`

Preview a retrieval to see what will be retrieved from the org, the potential conflicts, and the ignored files.

```
USAGE
  $ sf retrieve metadata preview [--json] [-c] [-o <value>]

FLAGS
  -c, --ignore-conflicts    Ignore conflicts and preview the retrieve of remote components, even if they will overwrite
                            local changes.
  -o, --target-org=<value>  Login username or alias for the target org.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Preview a retrieval to see what will be retrieved from the org, the potential conflicts, and the ignored files.

  You must run this command from within a project.

  The command outputs a table that describes what will happen if you run the "sf retrieve metadata" command. The table
  lists the metadata components that will be retrieved and deleted. The table also lists the current conflicts between
  files in your local project and components in the org. Finally, the table lists the files that won't be retrieved
  because they're included in your .forceignore file.

  If your org allows source tracking, then this command considers conflicts between the org and local. Some orgs, such
  as production orgs, never allow source tracking. Use the "--no-track-source" flag when you create a scratch or sandbox
  org to disable source tracking.

EXAMPLES
  Preview the retrieve of all changes from the org:

    $ sf retrieve metadata preview

  Preview the retrieve when ignoring any conflicts:

    $ sf retrieve metadata preview --ignore-conflicts

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -c, --ignore-conflicts

    Ignore conflicts and preview the retrieve of remote components, even if they will overwrite local changes.

    This flag applies only to orgs that allow source tracking. It has no effect on orgs that don't allow it, such as
    production orgs.

  -o, --target-org=<value>  Login username or alias for the target org.

    Overrides your default org.
