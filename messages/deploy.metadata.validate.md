# summary

Validate a metadata deployment without actually executing it.

# description

Use this command to verify whether a deployment will succeed without actually deploying the metadata to your org. This command is similar to "sf deploy metadata", except you're required to run Apex tests, and the command returns a job ID rather than executing the deployment. If the validation succeeds, then you pass this job ID to the "sf deploy metadata quick" command to actually deploy the metadata. This quick deploy takes less time because it skips running Apex tests. The job ID is valid for 10 days from when you started the validation. Validating first is useful if the deployment to your production org take several hours and you don’t want to risk a failed deploy.

You must run this command from within a project.

This command doesn't support source-tracking. When you quick deploy with the resulting job ID, the source you deploy overwrites the corresponding metadata in your org.

To validate the deployment of multiple metadata components, either set multiple --metadata <name> flags or a single --metadata flag with multiple names separated by spaces. Enclose names that contain spaces in one set of double quotes. The same syntax applies to --manifest and --source-dir.

# examples

- NOTE: These examples focus on validating large deployments. See the help for "sf deploy metadata" for examples of deploying smaller sets of metadata which you can also use to validate.

- Validate the deployment of all source files in a directory to the default org:

      <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --source-dir path/to/source

- Asynchronously validate the deployment and run all tests in the org with alias "my-prod-org"; command immediately returns the job ID:

      <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --source-dir path/to/source --async --test-level RunAllTestsInOrg --target-org my-prod-org

- Validate the deployment of all components listed in a manifest:

      <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --manifest path/to/package.xml

# flags.target-org.summary

Login username or alias for the target org.

# flags.target-org.description

Overrides your default org.

# flags.metadata.summary

Metadata component names to validate for deployment.

# flags.test-level.summary

Deployment Apex testing level.

# flags.test-level.description

Valid values are:

- RunSpecifiedTests — Runs only the tests that you specify with the --run-tests flag. Code coverage requirements differ from the default coverage requirements when using this test level. Executed tests must comprise a minimum of 75% code coverage for each class and trigger in the deployment package. This coverage is computed for each class and trigger individually and is different than the overall coverage percentage.

- RunLocalTests — All tests in your org are run, except the ones that originate from installed managed and unlocked packages. This test level is the default for production deployments that include Apex classes or triggers.

- RunAllTestsInOrg — All tests in your org are run, including tests of managed packages.

If you don’t specify a test level, the default behavior depends on the contents of your deployment package. For more information, see [Running Tests in a Deployment](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_deploy_running_tests.htm) in the "Metadata API Developer Guide".

# flags.source-dir.summary

Path to the local source files to validate for deployment.

# flags.source-dir.description

The supplied path can be to a single file (in which case the operation is applied to only one file) or to a folder (in which case the operation is applied to all metadata types in the directory and its subdirectories).

If you specify this flag, don’t specify --metadata or --manifest.

# flags.wait.summary

Number of minutes to wait for the command to complete and display results.

# flags.wait.description

If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns control of the terminal window to you and returns the job ID. To resume watching the validation, run "sf deploy metadata resume". To check the status of the validation, run "sf deploy metadata report".

# flags.manifest.summary

Full file path for manifest (package.xml) of components to validate for deployment.

# flags.manifest.description

All child components are included. If you specify this flag, don’t specify --metadata or --source-dir.

# flags.api.summary

The API to use for validating the deployment.

# flags.tests.summary

Apex tests to run when --test-level is RunSpecifiedTests.

# flags.verbose.summary

Show verbose output of the validation result.

# flags.concise.summary

Show concise output of the validation result.

# flags.api-version.summary

Target API version for the validation.

# flags.api-version.description

Use this flag to override the default API version with the API version of your package.xml file. The default API version is the latest version supported by the CLI.

# flags.async.summary

Run the command asynchronously.

# flags.async.description

The command immediately returns the job ID and control of the terminal to you. This way, you can continue to use the CLI. To resume watching the validation, run "sf deploy metadata resume". To check the status of the validation, run "sf deploy metadata report".

# flags.metadata-dir.summary

Root of directory or zip file of metadata formatted files to deploy.

# flags.single-package.summary

Indicates that the metadata zip file points to a directory structure for a single package.

# info.SuccessfulValidation

Successfully validated the deployment (%s).

# error.FailedValidation

Falied to validate the deployment (%s).
